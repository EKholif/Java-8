    //create streams for:
//    There are more ways to create streams, but for now, let’s just think of an array or collection.
//
//    When we want to modify or remove specific elements of an array, we could do so using a loop. And if we also want to keep the original, we’d have to make a copy. Say we have an array of names, and we want to have a list of names starting with an A, then something like this would do the trick.
//
//    We could also concatenate “student” to all the elements of the array using a loop, except if the name is “Maaike”, that would look something like this.
//
//    And when we weren’t working with an array, but with a list, we would have to make a copy if we wanted to remove certain items, else we’d get the concurrentmodificationexception.
//
//    So this is all working perfectly fine, but the syntax is not very elegant and maintenance could be hard. Especially not if we are going to make it more complex and perform multiple steps on the elements of the array or list.
